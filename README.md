code for a talk on STEM's lack of diversity I gave at astro on tap 10/15/2015 https://speakerdeck.com/fedhere/shallow-waters-in-stem
including publicly available data from NYC schools and Pluto and data on enrollment

uncommented

poorly formatted

barely reproducible

just sharing in the interest of transparency
